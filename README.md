### Problem 1
- Run the script with "python3 problem1.py YYYYMMDD currency_code" and the virtual environment
- Result stored in "result.txt"
- Note: I assume that the Chinese names of currencies on both websites are the same and have not made special distinctions in the code. However, in reality, some currency names are inconsistent (such as the JNY), and some currencies found on the Bank of China website are not found in the corresponding table (such as the Korean Won), I only give the general error handling for cases like that.

### Problem 2
- Run the script with the default IDE directly
